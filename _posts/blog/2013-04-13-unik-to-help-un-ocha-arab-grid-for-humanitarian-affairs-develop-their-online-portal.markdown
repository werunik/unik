[UN OCHA / Arab Grid for Humanitarian Affairs](http://unocha.com/ "UN OCHA / Arab Grid for Humanitarian Affairs"), part of the United Nations Secretariat responsible for humanitarian emergencies, has signed an outsourcing agreement with [Unik](http://unik.ma/ "Unik").
The agreement requires Unik to develop the UN OCHA multilingual online GIS and data reporting service under [Drupal 7](http://drupal.org/ "Drupal 7") platform.
The deal also covers responsive design and faceted search implementation along with agile project management.

>We, in Unik, are very excited with this opportunity as Technology is as essential for non profit organizations as it is for any business in today's networked economy. Unlike other businesses, NGOs typically lack the resources and the know-how to access these technologies that can make them more effective, efficient and sustainable in serving those at the margins of modern life, says Ismail Mechbal CEO of Unik.

OCHA is the part of the United Nations Secretariat responsible for bringing together humanitarian actors to ensure a coherent response to emergencies. OCHA also ensures there is a framework within which each actor can contribute to the overall response effort.

OCHA's mission is to:

* Mobilize and coordinate effective and principled humanitarian action in partnership with national and international actors in order to alleviate human suffering in disasters and emergencies.
* Advocate the rights of people in need.
* Promote preparedness and prevention.
* Facilitate sustainable solutions.
