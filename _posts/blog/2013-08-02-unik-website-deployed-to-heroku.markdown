Today we launched our website in Heroku plateform.

> Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) supporting several programming languages. Heroku is owned by Salesforce.com

Heroku works very smoothly with @[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll"), which we use for Unik website, we simply Git push to heroku and it automatically deploys it for us. No hassle anymore with FTP!

The performance will be definitely outstanding!
